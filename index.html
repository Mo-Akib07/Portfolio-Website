                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am 18 years old, currently in 1st year (Graduating 2024), pursuing a career in Computer Science & Engineering from Mohta PG College, Rajasthan, India. Born and brought up in Rajasthan, India.
                    I have done my schooling from Guru Ravindra Nath Tagore School, Taranagar(Churu) in 2017, with Science + Math as my background.
                    My idea behind taking up Computer Science & Engineering is my love for programming and Maths and the fact that, given the knowledge, I can make a computer do almost anything I want it to do.
                    I have a keen interest in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science, and I'm presently learning and working on the skills required to expertise in the same.
                    My hobbies include playing simulation games, such as increase Typing Speed, Learn English; reading articles, browsing YouTube recommendations, traveling, and binge watching Movies.
                    I am a firm believer of passion and determination can lead you to success.

                <p>
                    My idea behind taking up Computer Science is the problem-solving approach
                    and the fact that, given the knowledge and opportunity, there is almost 
                    nothing I can't do.
